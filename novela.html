        <p> Chapter 1: Awakening </p>

        <p>The year is 2056, and the ship Orrery 42 has been traveling to Mars for two years. The crew, in a state of cryogenic suspension to endure the long journey, has been completely inactive. However, the time has come for some to awaken. Something has gone terribly wrong. </p>

        <p>Captain Antonella Ricci is the first to wake up. She can barely take two steps out of her capsule before collapsing to the floor, a victim of a sudden dizziness and violent nausea. Vomiting is inevitable. Next to her, First Officer Gabriel Ibarra quickly follows suit, also affected by the side effects of the long cryogenic sleep. </p>

        <p>"Two years asleep and we wake up to this," Antonella jokes, breathless, as she tries to smile.</p>  

        <p>Gabriel lets out a weak laugh while wiping his mouth. </p>

        <p>After a quick, revitalizing shower, both begin to feel more like themselves. They dress and head to the ship's dining area, eager to eat something solid after so long. They sit at the table, happy to be awake and able to share a hot meal. Everything seems calm... until Antonella notices something strange. </p>

        <p>"Gabriel, look over there," Antonella says, nodding toward the back of the dining area.</p>

        <p>Gabriel follows her gaze and sees what she has spotted: two dirty tables, covered in plates and cups, as if someone had recently been eating there.</p>

        <p>"That doesn’t make sense," Gabriel murmurs, frowning. "We’re the first to wake up. No one else should have been here before."</p>

        <p>Antonella nods, concerned.</p>

        <p>"How can those tables be dirty if we’re the only ones awake?"</p>

        <p>They decide to investigate. Checking the ship's logs, they confirm that, according to the data, only the two of them have exited cryogenic suspension. However, those dirty plates suggest otherwise. </p>

        <p>Suddenly, a dry metallic sound echoes through the depths of the ship. It comes from the engineering room.</p>

       <p> "Did you hear that?" Antonella asks, her voice barely a whisper.</p>

        <p>Gabriel nods. They cautiously make their way to the engineering room, moving through the silent metal corridors. Upon arrival, they discover that the door is blocked. With effort, Gabriel manages to force it open manually, but what they find on the other side leaves them paralyzed.</p>

        <p>"My God!" Antonella screams, stepping back in shock.</p>

        <p>Gabriel rushes to her side, but what he sees leaves him equally stunned. Two bodies lie on the engineering room floor, decomposed and covered in crew uniforms. The sight is horrific; the faces of the corpses are unrecognizable due to decomposition.</p>

        <p>"This... shouldn’t be happening," Gabriel murmurs, his voice trembling.</p>

        <p>Antonella, still in shock, notices something shiny next to one of the bodies: a memory device. She picks it up, knowing it could hold answers.</p>

        <p>They return to the control room, where they connect the device to the main console. After a few seconds of waiting, a video appears on the screen. In it, one of the crew members’ faces is visible, looking visibly tired and scared.</p>

        <p>"If you’re seeing this, everything has gone wrong," the man says, his voice cracking. "The ship was hit by an asteroid. There was severe damage to the cryogenic system. Some of us woke up too early... but many didn’t make it. Most of the crew couldn’t survive... we tried, but it wasn’t enough. If you’re seeing this, it means that you and three others didn’t wake up with us..."

        The video cuts off abruptly. Antonella and Gabriel remain silent, processing what they’ve seen.</p>

       <p>"So... the ship was hit by an asteroid," Antonella says. "And the whole crew woke up early... except for us."
   
        "And most died," Gabriel adds, grimacing in pain.

        Determined not to face this situation alone, Antonella and Gabriel activate the cryogenic capsules of the two remaining crew members: Joaquín and Maca. Soon, both begin to awaken, experiencing the same symptoms of nausea and weakness their companions did.<</p>

        <p>"Welcome to the chaos," Gabriel jokes, handing them towels.

        "This isn’t what I expected upon waking... I thought at least there would be a cup of coffee waiting," Maca says, trying to lighten the tension with humor.

        After recovering and taking a shower, they gather in the dining area, where Antonella tells them everything that has happened. Joaquín and Maca listen in silence, trying to process the news of the accident and the deaths of their crewmates.</p>

        <p>"So... are they all dead?" Maca asks, her voice breaking with disbelief.

        "Yes," Antonella replies gently. "We’re the only ones left, but we have a chance. The ship is still functioning, though it’s severely damaged."

        Joaquín and Maca, visibly affected, take some time to absorb everything. After a few hours, they feel calmer and decide to meet with the team to plan their next steps.

        "Our first task is to take care of the bodies," Antonella says. "We can’t leave them here."</p>

        <p>The team heads to the engineering room, where they prepare their companions' bodies for a space burial. With respect and solemnity, they open the airlock, and one by one, the bodies are cast into the void of space, disappearing into the infinite darkness.

        "Rest in peace," murmurs Gabriel as the airlock closes.

        With the weight of duty fulfilled, the team feels a strange relief. For the first time since waking up, they can start focusing on the ship's problems.</p>

        <p>"Captain," Joaquín says, stepping forward, "Maca and I have checked some systems, and while there’s bad news, there’s also some hope. Life support is in emergency mode, but we can survive for a while. However, communications are completely offline."

            "We can’t call for help," adds Maca. "We’re isolated."

            "And propulsion?" Antonella asks.

            "Propulsion is damaged but not destroyed," Joaquín explains. "With what we have, we could try to repair it, but it will be complicated. We need some parts that aren’t easy to come by."</p>

          <p>Antonella nods, processing the information.

            "Okay, we have a plan," she finally says. "First, we fix the propulsion. That will give us more mobility. Then we’ll try to restore communications. If we manage both, we’ll find a way to reach Mars or, at least, get back home."

            "All right," Maca responds, determination in her voice.

            "Let’s get to work," Joaquín adds, ready for the task.

            With a clear purpose, the team disperses throughout the ship to begin the repairs. The path will be difficult, but for the first time since they woke up, they have a clear goal. And that gives them the hope they need to move forward.</p>

            <p>Chapter 2: Necessary Resources</p>

                <p>After what felt like endless days of hard work and complicated repairs, Joaquín and Maca finally manage to restore the thrusters of the ship Orrery 42. Exhausted but satisfied, they rush to the control room to deliver the good news to Captain Antonella Ricci and First Officer Gabriel Ibarra.

                “We did it!” Joaquín announces, a relieved smile on his face. “The thrusters are ready to go as soon as you order it, Captain.”

                Maca, still breathless from the effort, nods with pride.

                “Yes, we were able to make some makeshift repairs, but they’re working. The ship can move again.”</p>

                <p>However, instead of the joyful smiles they expected, they find Antonella and Gabriel with worried expressions. Both are staring at the navigation screen with furrowed brows, as if they’ve discovered something terrible.

                Joaquín frowns at their faces.

                “What’s wrong?” he asks, noticing the tension in the air.

                Antonella glances at Gabriel for a moment before responding, then turns to them, her eyes full of seriousness.

                “I was able to get the navigation system working again,” Antonella begins, speaking slowly, as if she’s still processing what she’s discovered. “But when I tried to set a course back to Earth... it didn’t detect any route.”

                Maca steps forward, incredulous. </p>

             <p>“What do you mean it didn’t detect a route?” she asks, trying to understand. “Is it a system problem?”

                Antonella shakes her head, clearly uneasy.

                “No, it’s not a system error,” Antonella replies, her voice lower, almost whispering. “I’m afraid we’re not in our solar system.”

                The silence that follows is overwhelming. Antonella's words hit like a wave of cold. Joaquín and Maca exchange glances, trying to process what they’ve just heard.

                “What... how can we not be in our solar system?” exclaims Maca, her voice trembling with confusion. “What does that mean? Where are we?”

                Antonella bites her lip, her gaze fixed on the screen. </p>

                <p>“I don’t know for sure,” admits the captain. “But according to the analysis of the star positions, we’re definitely not in the solar system. The constellations are misaligned. Something has thrown us off course, and now... I don’t know exactly where we are.”

                Joaquín, who has been silent until now, steps closer to the console, studying the readings on the screens.

                “But that’s impossible,” he says, trying to keep calm. “Even if the asteroid hit us, the ship should have activated emergency routes to Mars or at least back to Earth. How could we have ended up so far away?”

                “I don’t know,” Antonella replies, her eyes glued to the star data. “All I know is that... we’re not in our neighborhood.”

                Maca takes a step back, feeling the vertigo of the situation. </p>

                <p>“And what are we going to do now?” she asks, trying to find any hope in the situation. “We can’t stay here not knowing where we are.”

                Gabriel, who has been silent all this time, finally steps forward.

                “We’re completely off course,” he says, his voice firm. “But that doesn’t mean we’re lost. We have thrusters, we have life support. What we need now is a plan to orient ourselves.”

                Joaquín slowly nods, though his mind still struggles to grasp the situation.

                “All right then,” he says, looking at Antonella. “What’s the next step?”

                Antonella crosses her arms and takes a moment to think before speaking. </p>

                <p>“First, we need to map our position as best we can,” she says, pointing to the controls on the navigation console. “We have to use the stars we can recognize to try to locate ourselves. We know we’re not in the solar system, but maybe we’re near a star we can identify. It’s the only thing we have for now.”

                Maca frowns, a mix of confusion and fear in her voice.

                “And what if we can’t identify anything? What if we’re farther away than we thought?”

                Antonella looks at her seriously.

                “If we can’t identify ourselves, we’ll proceed with what we know,” Antonella replies. “We can start moving toward the closest sector that has a familiar star configuration. Space is vast, but we’re not without options.”

                Joaquín steps forward, determined.</p>

                <p>“We need to get the communications working,” he says. “If we manage to restore the system, we could try to send a distress signal. Maybe someone, somewhere, can hear us.”

                Gabriel nods.

                “Yes, that will be our priority after we locate our position. If we manage to contact someone, we can find a way to get home, or at least understand what really happened.”

                Antonella straightens up, looking at her team with determination.

                “Listen,” she says. “I know this feels like a nightmare. But we have a functioning ship, a capable crew, and time to think of a solution. We will not give up. We start by tracking our location and fixing communications. It’s a long road, but we’re not defeated. We won’t be stranded without a fight.”

                “I’m with you, Captain,” Joaquín replies determinedly.</p>

                <p>“So am I,” Maca adds, taking a deep breath.

                Gabriel smiles slightly, knowing that despite the chaos and uncertainty, the team remains united.

                “Together we’ll get through this,” Gabriel concludes, looking at everyone.

                With the decision made, the team disperses to get to work. The uncertainty of being in an unknown place weighs on them, but they have a plan, and for the first time since waking up, they feel they can fight for their future.</p>

            <p>Chapter 3: New Plans</p>

                <p>After coming to terms with the bewildering reality that the ship Orrery 42 was completely off course and out of the solar system, Captain Antonella Ricci gathered her team to outline the next step. They knew they were alone, but they also knew they couldn’t sit idly by.

                “Listen up, everyone,” Antonella said, her tone that of a determined leader. “We’ve recovered some systems, but our situation is critical. If we want to get out of here, we’ll need more than just thrusters and life support. The ship has significant damage, and unless we obtain materials to repair it, we won’t be able to move forward much longer.”

                Gabriel, Joaquín, and Maca listened attentively, all aware that what would come next wouldn’t be easy.</p>

                <p>“The plan is this,” Antonella continued. “I will use the data we have to identify nearby exoplanets that we can explore. We need to find minerals or resources that can help us repair the damaged systems of the ship, particularly propulsion and communications.”

                Maca raised her hand, her face still full of questions.

                “And how are we going to do that?” she asked. “We don’t even know exactly where we are or what kind of planets are out here.”

                Antonella nodded, understanding the concern.

                “That’s true; we’re in unknown territory,” she admitted. “But according to the star readings, there are several nearby systems we can explore. I’ll focus on finding planets that are within a safe range for travel and that are likely to have the resources we need. We don’t know exactly what we’ll find, but we have to try.”

                Joaquín nodded, his technical mind already beginning to think about the possibilities. </p>

                <p>“And how do we divide the work?” he asked.

                    Antonella straightened up, looking at each of her crew members.

                    “Gabriel and you,” she said, looking at Joaquín, “will be in charge of the exploration. When we find a suitable planet, you’ll go down to the surface to explore and extract the necessary minerals or materials for repairs.”

                    Gabriel leaned forward, nodding slowly.

                    “Understood. We’ll handle the exploration and extraction.”

                    “Maca,” Antonella continued, turning her attention to the systems engineer, “your task will be to ensure that everything you bring from the outside is properly disinfected. We don’t know what kinds of bacteria, viruses, or unknown elements we might encounter on those planets. We can’t risk contaminating the ship.”</p>

                    <p>Maca nodded immediately.

                    “I’ll make sure everything is clean and safe before anything enters the ship. We won’t let anything from the outside affect us,” she affirmed, feeling useful amid so much uncertainty.

                    With the plan in motion, everyone began preparing for their respective tasks. Antonella focused on the navigation console, searching among nearby systems for any planet that could be useful for the mission.</p>

                    <p>Chapter 4: The Search Begins</p>


         
                    <p>Finally, after what felt like days of relentless searching, Antonella found what she was looking for.

                        —I’ve got it—she said, calling the others' attention—. I found a planet that could serve us. It’s an exoplanet called Kepler-452b.

                        Joaquín quickly approached the console, examining the data on the screen.

                        —Kepler-452b... I’ve heard of it—he murmured while studying the graphs—. It’s a rocky planet, right? Slightly larger than Earth, and it’s in the habitable zone of its star. It could be promising.

                        —Exactly—Antonella replied—. The data shows a high probability that it has useful minerals for repairs. Its atmosphere is similar to Earth's, making it a good candidate for exploration.

                        Gabriel crossed his arms, his gaze fixed on the screen.

                        —What are the risks?—he asked—. We know it's in the habitable zone, but we have no idea what we might find there. Could there be life or some kind of threat? </p>

                        <p>Antonella pressed her lips together.

                        —It’s a possibility—she admitted—. But if we want to get out of here, we’ll have to take that risk. We can’t just do nothing. We’ll proceed with caution. You’ll go down, do a quick exploration, and ensure you’re not exposed to anything dangerous. If we find what we need, extract the materials and come back. If anything seems out of place, don’t hesitate to return immediately.

                        —Understood—Joaquín said, adjusting his uniform.

                        —We’ll be quick and careful—Gabriel added, in a serious tone.

                        Maca also chimed in.

                        —I’ll have everything ready in the cargo bay to disinfect anything you bring back—she said—. Nothing will enter the ship without going through my control.

                        Antonella nodded, satisfied with her team's preparation. </p>

                    <p>—Good—she said, looking at the three of them—. We’re going to Kepler-452b. If this planet has what we need, we could take a significant step toward repairing the ship and, hopefully, finding a way back home.

                    With the ship ready, the thrusters ignited, and the destination set, Orrery 42 headed toward the mysterious planet Kepler-452b. No one knew exactly what they would find on the surface, but everyone understood that this mission was their best and perhaps only opportunity to repair the ship and find a way back to Earth.</p>

            
                    <p>**Chapter 5: The Descent to Kepler-452b**</p>

                   <p> With the destination marked and the team ready, the ship Orrery 42 headed toward Kepler-452b, a rocky planet with promising features. The crew knew it would be a challenge, but this was their best chance to survive and repair the ship.

                    Joaquín and Gabriel were ready in the cargo bay, equipped with exploration suits and extraction tools. Maca was checking the disinfection systems while Antonella prepared the landing module that would take them to the surface.

                    —Are you sure about all the equipment?—Antonella asked, reviewing the control screens one last time.

                    —Ready—Joaquín replied, adjusting his helmet—. We have everything we need for a quick exploration. We won’t be on the surface any longer than necessary.

                    Gabriel, already suited up, gave a thumbs up. </p>

                    <p>—We’ll make sure to return with what we need.

                        Antonella nodded, a mix of concern and hope in her eyes.

                        —Good, don’t take unnecessary risks. If anything seems strange, return immediately. We’ll be monitoring you from here.

                        The landing module gently lifted off from the Orrery 42 and began its descent into the atmosphere of Kepler-452b. The planet, larger than Earth, unfolded before them with vast mountainous terrains and dark valleys. The initial readings indicated a breathable atmosphere, but the team didn’t remove their protective suits, just in case.

                        Upon landing in a rocky plain, Joaquín and Gabriel began their mission. </p>

                       <p> —The gravity is notably stronger—Gabriel said, adjusting his pace as he moved across the uneven terrain—. It’s what we expected with a more massive planet.

                        —Nothing we can’t handle—Joaquín replied, examining the ground with his scanner—. Let’s look for those minerals.

                    Joaquín’s scanner soon gave a positive signal. Beneath the rocky surface was a type of rare mineral that could be useful for repairing the ship’s damaged systems.

                    —I’ve got it—Joaquín said, pointing to an area a few meters away—. The scanners show a high concentration of tungsten and other metallic elements. This could be just what we need for the repairs.

                    —Perfect—Gabriel replied, pulling out the extraction tools—. Let’s get to work.</p>

                    <p>Both began to dig into the rock, extracting mineral fragments quickly and efficiently. Time seemed to fly as they worked, but everything appeared to be going smoothly.

                    After several hours of hard work, Joaquín held up a shiny sample of mineral in his hand.

                    —Here it is. This should be enough—he carefully placed it in a container, ensuring everything was secured for the return.

                    Gabriel looked around, observing the mysterious landscape of Kepler-452b. There were no signs of intelligent life, but something about the planet made him feel uneasy.

                    —We better head back—he said, giving one last look at the horizon—. I don’t like this feeling.

                    Joaquín nodded. </p>

                   <p> —Okay, let’s return to the ship.

                    Both boarded the landing module, and within minutes, they left the atmosphere of Kepler-452b, returning to the Orrery 42.

                    Upon entering the cargo bay, Maca was already prepared to disinfect everything they brought back from the planet. They ensured they went through rigorous decontamination procedures before entering the ship with the materials.

                    —Everything seems in order—Maca said, checking the containers with a smile—. The mineral is clean. Now we can work with it without worries.

                    Antonella was waiting for them in the control room, eager to hear the results.

                    —How did it go?—she asked, relieved to see them safe and sound.

                    Joaquín proudly held up the container. </p>

                    <p>—We’ve got it—he said—. This mineral should be enough to repair the damaged systems. It’s just what we needed.

                    Antonella exhaled a sigh of relief.

                    —Incredible. Now we can focus on the repairs. Great job, guys.

                    Gabriel nodded, though he still looked thoughtful.

                    —The planet is impressive, but I can’t shake the feeling that there was something else there... something we didn’t see.

                    Antonella looked at him with curiosity.

                    —What do you mean?

                    Gabriel shook his head, a slight smile on his face.

                    —Nothing that matters now. The important thing is that we returned with what we needed.

                    Antonella smiled and turned to the team </p>.

                    <p>—Then let’s get to work. Let’s fix this ship and keep moving forward.

                    With the mineral in hand, Joaquín and Maca began the repair process. The alloy obtained from Kepler-452b turned out to be more resilient than they expected, making it easier to reinforce the damaged structures. With each step of the repair, the crew felt they were a bit closer to regaining full control of the ship.

                    They spent several days working tirelessly, but they finally managed to repair the propulsion systems and stabilize the life support. Now, there was one crucial step left: to attempt to repair the communications and look for a way to contact Earth or any rescue signals.

                    Meanwhile, Orrery 42 continued on its mysterious trajectory in a corner of the universe they didn’t know. But with the ship almost repaired and the team closer than ever, there was hope. They were ready to face whatever came next.</p>

                <p>**Chapter 6: The Search for More Resources**</p>

                    <p>After the success of the mission on Kepler-452b, the crew of the Orrery 42 was ready to continue their search for resources on other exoplanets. Despite the initial repairs, they still needed more materials to ensure the ship could operate optimally.

                    Captain Antonella Ricci gathered the team in the control room.

                    —Kepler-452b provided us with what we needed to stabilize the ship—Antonella began—. But if we want everything to function properly in the long run, we need to explore more nearby planets. There are still several systems to investigate.

                    Gabriel looked at the screen, where the graphs of the adjacent planetary systems appeared.

                    —There are a couple of exoplanets in the habitable zone of the Trappist-1 system—he suggested—. We could head there.

                    Joaquín nodded, intrigued.

                    —I’ve heard Trappist-1 has several interesting planets. It could be a good place to search for more minerals and resources.

                    Maca, meanwhile, was reviewing the data from the probes.

                    —Additionally, preliminary analyses suggest that some of those planets have compounds we might need to improve the life support system.

                    Antonella smiled, satisfied with her team’s contributions.

                    —Then it’s a plan. We’ll head to Trappist-1. Let’s prepare the exploration module and check that everything is in order.

                    The crew quickly began to work. While Joaquín and Gabriel prepared the module, Maca checked the safety and decontamination systems. </p>

                  <p>  Shortly after, the Orrery 42 was on course for the Trappist-1 system. During the journey, the crew discussed strategies and potential risks.

                    —We might encounter other explorers or even colonies on some of these planets—Gabriel commented—. We need to be ready for anything.

                    —Exactly—Antonella replied—. The priority is safety. If we find life, we’ll need to act cautiously.

                    As the ship advanced through space, the crew remained alert. After a couple of days of</p>

                   <p>  Chapter 7: New Explorations </p>

                       <p> —There are three exoplanets that could be useful —the captain continued—. Each one is very different from the others, but we need to visit them and assess if they have the resources we need. We’ll use the same approach: quick exploration, material extraction, and safe return to the ship.

                       With a clear plan, the crew prepared for the next phase of their mission. The first destination: HD 189733b.

                        First Exoplanet: HD 189733b

                        This planet was very different from Kepler-452b. HD 189733b is a gas giant located about 63 light-years from Earth. The ship descended to a safe altitude, as this planet didn’t have a solid surface like rocky planets. Instead, the necessary resources were found in the dense clouds of its atmosphere. </p>

                        <p>—This place is completely different from anything we’ve seen —Joaquín said as he observed the blue storms raging below the ship—. We can’t land, but we can use the extraction drones to get what we need.

                        Gabriel, controlling the systems of the module, nodded.

                        —The storms are incredibly violent. These clouds are loaded with silicates and magnesium, which could be useful for enhancing the ship’s defense and thermal protection systems.</p>

                       <p> Antonella monitored the operation from the ship as the drones descended into the dense atmosphere of the gas giant. The powerful storms of wind and silicate crystals battered the drones, but they managed to stay stable enough to collect small amounts of the necessary materials.

                    After several hours of collection, the drones successfully returned to the landing module. The materials were quickly disinfected and secured in the ship.</p>

                   <p> —Good job —Antonella said as the team reviewed the samples—. This material will reinforce the ship to better withstand the extreme conditions we might encounter later.

                   With the mission accomplished on HD 189733b, they prepared for the next destination.

                   Second Exoplanet: Gliese 1214b

                    The second planet was Gliese 1214b, a completely different aquatic world. This exoplanet was covered by vast deep oceans and could contain valuable resources beneath its waters. It was an oceanic planet located 47 light-years away.</p>

                   <p> —This planet is basically an endless ocean —Maca commented as the ship approached the atmosphere of Gliese 1214b—. It’s likely that the ocean floor contains rare minerals, but we need to extract quickly. We don’t know what might be in those waters.

                    Joaquín and Gabriel prepared again to descend, this time in a module designed to submerge in water. The plan was to reach the depths and collect mineral samples that might be hidden beneath the ocean floor.

                    —The pressure here is much greater than on Earth —Gabriel explained as he piloted the module underwater—. But it seems stable. Let’s look for deposits of magnesium and lithium.</p>

                   <p> The module descended slowly as darkness enveloped the crew. Finally, the scanners detected the minerals they were looking for. After a quick extraction operation, the team managed to collect what they needed and ascend to the surface.

                    —This should help improve the ship’s electrical and energy systems —Joaquín said as he examined the samples.

                    Back on the Orrery 42, Maca ensured that all materials were properly disinfected before entering the ship.

                    —Everything’s in order —she said, satisfied with the process—. Looks like we’re on the right track.</p>

                   <p> With the mission accomplished on Gliese 1214b, the team prepared for the last planet.

                    Third Exoplanet: WASP-12b

                    The last planet on their list was WASP-12b, a hot Jupiter located about 870 light-years from Earth. This planet was so close to its star that temperatures in its atmosphere reached extreme levels.

                    —This place is blazing —Gabriel said, observing the orange glow of the planet from the ship—. But according to the data, we can find carbon and other useful elements in its upper atmosphere.</p>

                   <p> The strategy on WASP-12b would be similar to that of HD 189733b. They couldn’t land, but they could use the drones to collect materials from its hellish atmosphere.

                    —The drones are ready —Joaquín announced as the devices deployed and descended towards the outer layers of the planet.

                    The extreme temperatures and proximity to the star made the operation risky, but the drones were designed to withstand extreme conditions. </p>

                  <p>  —We’re collecting carbon particles in their purest form —Gabriel reported as he monitored the process—. This will help reinforce the ship's thermal protection layers.

                After several hours of operation, the drones returned successfully to the module with the necessary materials. Upon arrival at the Orrery 42, Maca once again disinfected all the cargo before storing it in the ship.

                —That was intense —Joaquín commented, relieved to see that everything had gone well.

                Antonella smiled, pleased with the results.

                —We did it. Now we have the resources we need from these three planets. We can begin the full repairs on the ship and prepare for whatever comes next.</p>

               <p> Chapter 8: The Final Challenge </p>

                <p> After the successful missions on HD 189733b, Gliese 1214b, and WASP-12b, the crew of the Orrery 42 had gathered the necessary resources to improve and strengthen the ship. They were one step closer to restoring their ability to travel safely, even though the journey home still seemed distant.

                Still, one key element was missing to ensure they could return to Earth: the fuel needed to activate the interstellar jump back to their solar system.

                Captain Antonella Ricci gathered her team to discuss their next and final destination.

                —We’ve gathered crucial materials from the last three planets —Antonella said, looking at Gabriel, Joaquín, and Maca—. But we still need one important thing: the fuel necessary </p>   

                <p>Joaquín looked up, intrigued.

                —What kind of planet is it? —he asked, already thinking about the preparations.

                Antonella displayed the data on the main screen.

                —It’s an exoplanet called 55 Cancri e —Antonella explained—. It’s a rocky world very different from the others we’ve visited. It’s located about 41 light-years from Earth, and it’s believed that its core could be filled with carbides and hydrocarbons that, if we manage to extract them, could serve as the necessary fuel for the interstellar jump.

                Gabriel frowned as he analyzed the data.

                —55 Cancri e... I’ve read about it —he said thoughtfully—. It’s known as a "diamond planet." Its temperatures are extreme, and its surface is exposed to intense radiation due to its proximity to its host star. But if what you say is true, we could find there what we need to get back home.

                Maca, in charge of the disinfection and analysis systems, nodded seriously.

                —If we’re going to do this, we need to be very quick. The conditions on that planet are much more hostile than anywhere we’ve been.

                Antonella nodded.

               —Okay, we’ll prepare just like before: quick extraction, return to the ship, and complete disinfection. This is our last step to be able to go home. We will do it carefully, but we need to do it quickly.</p>

                 <p>Chapter 9: 55 Cancri e</p>

                <p>The Orrery 42 approached 55 Cancri e, a bright planet with its surface burning due to the extreme temperatures and the intense radiation from its star. This world, many times more massive than Earth, had an almost supernatural appearance. Its surface, beneath the gas clouds, was rumored to be formed by carbonaceous rocks and diamonds due to its carbon-rich composition.

                The team knew this was their most dangerous mission yet.

                Gabriel and Joaquín prepared in the landing module, while Antonella monitored them from the ship and Maca organized the disinfection equipment.

                —The scanners show large amounts of solid carbon beneath the surface —said Antonella—. It’s likely that we can extract enough to use as fuel. But the conditions are extreme, so don’t stay there longer than necessary.

                Gabriel, adjusting his protective suit, nodded.

                —As soon as we have enough, we’ll return immediately. We won’t take any unnecessary risks.</p>

                <p>Chapter 10: The Dangerous Mission </p>

               <p> The landing module descended toward 55 Cancri e. The planet's atmosphere was suffocating, and the heat enveloped the module as if it were a giant oven. However, thanks to the protective layers, the team was prepared to withstand the temperatures for a limited time.

                —The gravity is very strong —said Joaquín as he stepped onto the rocky surface of the planet—. But the scanner readings are clear. There are massive amounts of carbon here. If we can obtain enough, this will take us home.

                Gabriel began operating the extraction equipment, quickly drilling into the surface and collecting the valuable minerals rich in hydrocarbons and carbides. The process was difficult due to the high temperatures and extreme gravity, but the reward was vital.

                —I have what we need —Gabriel said after an hour, sweat covering his forehead despite the cooling systems of the suit—. This should be enough to fuel the thrusters and activate the interstellar jump.

                —Let’s return immediately —Joaquín said, feeling the heat intensifying—. I don’t want to stay here a minute longer.</p>

               <p> Back in the landing module, they began the ascent back to the ship. As the planet receded below them, relief began to fill the atmosphere. They had done it: they had the last resource they needed.

                When the module returned to the Orrery 42, Maca ensured that everything underwent rigorous disinfection.

                —The fuel is clean and ready to be used —she announced after completing the review—. We have nothing more to do here. We can go home! </p>

               <p> Chapter 11: The Return Home</p>

                <p>With the fuel extracted from 55 Cancri e, Joaquín and Maca began the process of integrating the hydrocarbons into the ship’s propulsion systems. They knew this was the moment they had been waiting for since they woke up in a corner of the universe so far away.

                —Everything is ready —Joaquín said, watching the controls closely—. The thrusters have enough energy to make the interstellar jump.

                Antonella approached the navigation console, observing the coordinates they had marked for Earth. With the necessary resources and fuel in place, there was only one more step left.

                —Gabriel, initiate the jump when you’re ready —Antonella said, her voice firm but full of emotion.

                Gabriel nodded, activating the controls.

                —Preparing for the jump in three... two... one...

                The Orrery 42 began to vibrate gently as the propulsion systems activated. The stars in space distorted for a moment, and then suddenly, everything faded into a brilliant flash.

                They had made the jump.

                After a brief moment of tension, the readings showed what everyone had been waiting for.

                —We did it —Maca said, a smile of relief on her face—. We are on our way back to Earth. </p>

               <p> Chapter 12: What Will Happen?</p>

                <p>The Orrery 42 traveled safely toward Earth. The team was relaxed, enjoying their success and the fact that they would soon be home. However, just when they thought the journey wouldn’t have any more surprises, alarms began to sound in the control room.

                —Captain, something is happening —Joaquín said, frowning as he looked at the screens.

                —What’s going on? —Antonella asked, approaching.

                Gabriel was checking the communication systems when his screen lit up with an unexpected message.

                —We’re receiving a distress signal —Gabriel said, clearly surprised—. It’s coming from a nearby ship.

                —A nearby ship? —Gabriel asked incredulously—. That doesn’t make sense. There shouldn’t be any ships here.

                Maca frowned as she reviewed the scanning systems.

                —That’s impossible. We are outside the known commercial space routes. No one should be here.

                Antonella, her gaze fixed on the screen, took a deep breath. Although they had just come out of a life-threatening experience, she knew she couldn’t ignore a distress signal. Her instinct as captain and her responsibility toward others in danger left her no choice.

                —We will respond to that distress signal —Antonella decided with determination...</p>
